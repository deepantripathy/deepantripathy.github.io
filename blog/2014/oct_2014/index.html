            <p class="blog-post-meta">Thursday,September 4, 2014 by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/deepan.tripathy">Deepan </a> with <a href="http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/profile/286850/"> Siddarth</a></p>

            <p>Well sorry guys that I blogged about my "Experience of The Haunted House" so late since it took me about a month to get over it. Well today is October 2,2014 and first a very happy Durga Puja and Dussehra to all the readers.</p>

            <p>I will request all of you to first go through my blog
              <a href="">A Day with @ Photographer</a>, so that it will be easy for you all to connect the points and understand my experience. So lets start off..</p>
            
            <p>It was about 5 in the evening when we got up from sleep and decided to stay back in Phulbani in my maternal grandfather's house. To seek more adventure we decided to venture into the haunted bungalows of Phulbani. It though sounds a bit scary but ye we did. I asked my grandfather about some of history, so he told me about a bungalow which once used to be the quarters of the DSP of Kandhamal region.</p>
            <p>The first incident there occured 30 years ago. My mom was studying in, I guess, 7th or 8th class. She and her friend, Anjali who was the daughter of then DSP, Kandhamal, had come over to my mom's house for a night-stay. That night changed the lives of Anjali aunty and her parents. She was normal till 10 or 10:30 but after that the evil spirit inside her showed it's true colours. My grandpa told me that she was trembling even though her body temperature was quite normal. He told me that she was not trembling like the one in which we catch cold or we are suffering from fever, it was like the entire bed was shaking. My grandpa told me that he felt as if she was under the control of some spirit but he was afraid to directly jump to conclusions after seeing the all this. The spirit again showed it's colours when on a class picnic. My grandpa told me that this picnic was organized by Anjali aunty's father and my grandpa, just to see whether the spirit would react or not. That day the entire class had gone to a water-fall and Anjali aunty suddenly fell ill. The teachers there informed my grandpa and aunty's father and left Anjali aunty all alone to sleep by the time they arrive. But who would know that in a matter of just an hour she will rise up and walk into the water as if she wanted to drown herself. She was very lucky that one of the teachers saw her and rushed to help her. When she woke up she said that she didn't remember anything. The teachers thought that she was trying to act smart, but it was my grandpa and aunty's father who became assured of the fact that a evil spirit rests in her. They took a lot of steps to take that spirit out of her body like pujas and all and she was alright within a matter of months. They left that bungalow and shifted to Bhubaneshwar.</p>
            <p>My grandpa even told me that any incidents have occured there in the past, in some cases even deaths. This is the prime reason that the Odisha state govt. has sealed of the bungalow. But my grandfather even said that it was only one spirit living there, who did all of that. I was shocked that one spirit can't do it all. But if there was only one spirit involved then I was very curious to meet him.</p>
            <p>We headed for the bungalow at 6 in the evening. We first questioned the people living nearby about that bungalow. One shocking thing that we came to know from an old lady living nearby in a hut that the spirit there was that of a lady. This lady once used to be a British and her husband was the owner of the ordinance factory in Phulbani. At first even I wondered if this is true or not but the old generation there say that the ordiance factory is about a century old, the Odisha govt has rebuilt it and modified it so it looks quite modern. I started wondering that how can the Britishers come to Phulbani a town so remote but I had to accept that fact to move further. We went to the bungalow and questioned about it. There is a police guard's room where the guards of the SP bungalow nearby stay. There they told us that some sort of sounds like as if a woman is screaming, come from the bungalow every time between 10 to 11 and then there is a pin drop silence. After talking to them I was assured of the fact that there are spirits in that bungalow but still I doubted the British lady stuff. Those police guards even told me that there was a retired guard of the bungalow still living in this town. We went to his home to know more about it. The guard told me everything about the bungalow, the British lady like everything. We were shocked. We could never imagine something like this could have ever happened. </p>

            <p>According to the retired old guard, it was in 1940s, a British family was living in the bungalow which is now the DSP bungalow. It was a nice happy family, husband, the owner of the ordinance factory, his wife and a little girl. Everything was nice, but then came the freedom movement, people of Phulbani burnt down the factory, imprisoned the British family and later burnt them alive, even that little girl. After independance the state govt. rebuilt both the factory but didn't touch or modified the quarters. Anjali aunty's father was the first one to be given the bungalow as DSP quarters.</p>

            <p>This story looked fake to us. We returned home at around 9:30 pm. After having our dinner we kept discussing about it. We decided to stay and look into the matter for a few more days. While we were sleeping we suddenly heard a voice like a woman was yelling outside. We were terrified to hear that. We rushed outside to see if there was someone but we could not see anybody outside. We thought for a second that it might have been that spirit. We went back, we tried our best to sleep but we could not. When we woke up in the morning, I asked my grandpa if he had heard something but he said no.</p>

            <p>It was 10 am so we decided to go inside that bungalow. We took the help of the retired guard to help us out. We told him that he should just stand beside the entry door and should look to it as if it doesn't close. We went in and started our search. We found nothing there, absolutely empty bungalow. Suddenly we heard a sound the same sound we heard at night. We were shocked, we cannot move an inch for a moment. The sound was so frightening. We gathered some courage and started to go towards the room from where this sound was coming. When we opened the door suddenly that sound stopped and a gown came straight on us. We got scared and ran towards the door where that old guard was waiting for us. He gave us water and told us that we were the first ones to come out of that bungalow alive. We sitting in the garden of that bungalow. We were so scared that we couldn't even drink water. We came back home but that gown incident had taken us aback. The gown didn't come on us, it was as if someone was wearing it, someone invisible. That gown had a perfect structure. We yet again decided that whether we should stay or not. I was speechless, I watched some horror movies. I made up my mind that I will not leave any loose ends. We took some rest, we slept the entire day only to spend a sleepless night so that we can crack down the voices. We switched off the lights of our room and went to the roof and hid behind a wall with a binocular just like what a sniper would do. It was 2 am when we heard that same sound. And then suddenly what we say shocked us. It was a man on a cycle sneakig past the road into the next lane. We became somewhat 60% assured that it was that man on the cycle who had been playing those sounds. We followed the same routine for the next 2 days and the same things occured, the same sound in that bungalow, the same room, gown coming over us and we ruuning back. But for the next 2 nights what we say made us 100% assured that there was someone who was trying to scare people in the name of a ghost. In the next 2 nights we say the same man on the cycle, he came towards our window played that sound on his mobile phone and ran away. We had it all video recorded. But still we had nothing to prove that those men were trying to do something else. Well my uncle helped me in this matter. He has a very bad habit of chewing tobacco so I was very familiar with it's smell. I thought for a moment and noticed that every time I went there there is a smell of tobacco.</p> 
            <p>So we decided to go there again, but this time we decide to go from the backend of the bungalow. I say a room with lights on in that bungalow. We sneaked our way into the compound and say that illegal tobacco and drugs production was going on there. We had come very close to it, I informed the police from an STD booth so that they couldn't trace my number. Those criminals were caught, we were relived to see that we had succeeded. </p>

            <p>While we were returning towards BBSR, feeling proud of what we had done, I was concerned about one thing and that was, that those criminals had confessed their crime and said that they had killed everybody after the spirit incident of Anjali aunty and to cover up their murders they used that spirit. But who was the spirit that actually attacked Anjali aunty?? I will try to collect some more facts about the spirit inside Anjali aunty and blog about it in near future.</p>

            <p>In the end I would like to say that the mindset of people needs to be changed. Look people are now using spirits to run their illegal business. We should show some humanity towards spirits. They are spirits because they didn't recieve any during their lifetime. I hope you liked my blog about the adventure of the haunted house <br/> Thank you</p>
